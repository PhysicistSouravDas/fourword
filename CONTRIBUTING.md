# Contributing to FourWord
We are glad you're willing to contribute to this project, you can read about it in detail [here](https://github.com/dadwalakshay/fourword/blob/master/README.md)

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Make sure it doesn't break anything.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPLv3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/dadwalakshay/fourword/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Python's PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs

## License
